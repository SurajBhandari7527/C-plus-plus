/* Summary of Learning:
Access from Enclosing to Nested: The enclosing class cannot directly access the private members 
of the nested class. This enforces encapsulation and requires the use of accessor functions or 
friend declarations to allow such access.Access from Nested to Enclosing: The nested class has 
full access to the members (including private members) of the enclosing class. This is because 
the nested class is considered an intimate part of the enclosing class.
